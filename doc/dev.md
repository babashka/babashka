# Developing Babashka

You need [lein](https://leiningen.org/) for running JVM tests and/or producing uberjars. For building binaries you need GraalVM. Currently we use java8-19.3.1.

## Clone repository

To work on Babashka itself make sure Git submodules are checked out.

``` shellsession
$ git clone https://github.com/borkdude/babashka --recursive
```

To update later on:

``` shellsession
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

## REPL

`lein repl` will get you a standard REPL/nREPL connection. To work on tests use `lein with-profiles +test repl`.

### Adding classes

Add necessary classes to `babashka/impl/classes.clj`.  For every addition, write
a unit test, so it's clear why it is added and removing it will break the
tests. Try to reduce the size of the binary by only adding the necessary parts
of a class in `:instance-check`, `:constructors`, `:methods`, `:fields` or
`:custom`.

The `reflection.json` file that is needed for GraalVM compilation is generated
with:

    lein with-profiles +reflection run

## Test

Test on the JVM (for development):

    script/test

Test the native version:

    BABASHKA_TEST_ENV=native script/test

## Build

To build this project, set `$GRAALVM_HOME` to the GraalVM distribution directory. Currently we are using GraalVM JDK8.

Then run:

    $ script/compile

To tweak maximum heap size:

```
$ BABASHKA_XMX="-J-Xmx4g" script/compile
```

## Binary size

Keep notes here about how adding libraries and classes to Babashka affects the binary size.
We're registering the size of the macOS binary (as built on CircleCI).
