# Developing Babashka

You need [lein](https://leiningen.org/) for running JVM tests and/or producing uberjars. For building binaries you need GraalVM. Currently we use java11-20.2.0.

## Clone repository

To work on Babashka itself make sure Git submodules are checked out.

``` shellsession
$ git clone https://github.com/borkdude/babashka --recursive
```

To update later on:

``` shellsession
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

## REPL

`lein repl` will get you a standard REPL/nREPL connection. To work on tests use `lein with-profiles +test repl`.

## Adding classes

Add necessary classes to `babashka/impl/classes.clj`.  For every addition, write
a unit test, so it's clear why it is added and removing it will break the
tests. Try to reduce the size of the binary by only adding the necessary parts
of a class in `:instance-check`, `:constructors`, `:methods`, `:fields` or
`:custom`.

The `reflection.json` file that is needed for GraalVM compilation is generated
as part of `script/uberjar`.

## Test

Test on the JVM (for development):

    script/test

Test the native version:

    BABASHKA_TEST_ENV=native script/test

## Tests for Libraries

Babashka runs tests of libraries that are compatible with it through
`script/run_lib_tests`. To add tests for a new library, do the following:

* Add an entry for the library in `deps.edn` under the `:lib-tests` alias.
* Create a directory for the library in `test-resources/lib_tests/` and copy its tests to there.
* Add an entry in `run_all_libtests.clj` to run the added test namespaces.


## Build

See [build.md](build.md).

## JDBC

Findings from various experiments with JDBC drivers in babashka:

- Postgres: adds 3MB to the binary. It seems the maintainers have put in effort
  to make the driver compatible with Graal. The driver is part of `bb` since
  `v0.0.89`.
- Sqlite: I feel like I'm close to a working solution, but it hangs. It adds
  20MB to the binary. Since sqlite has a nice CLI we could also just shell out
  to it (there's an example in the examples dir). We could also build a
  `babashka.sqlite` namespace around the CLI maybe similar to
  `babashka.curl`. See [#385](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/issues/385)
  for details.
- HSQLDB: easy to get going with Graalvm. Adds 10 MB to the binary. It's under a
  feature flag right now on master. See [build.md](build.md) for details. Derby
  and H2 are known to not work with GraalVM, so far this is the "best" embedded
  option from a Graal perspective.  Setting the -Xmx value for Docker to 4500m
  got it to crash. 4800m did work, but it took 17 minutes (compared to 10
  minutes without this feature).
- MySQL / MariaDB: can't get those to work yet. Work in progress in issue
  [#387](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/issues/387).

To progress work on sqlite and mySQL, I need a working Clojure example. If you
want to contribute, consider making a an example Clojure GraalVM CLI that puts
something in a sqlite / mysql DB and reads something from it.

## Binary size

Keep notes here about how adding libraries and classes to Babashka affects the binary size.
We're registering the size of the macOS binary (as built on CircleCI).
