## v0.2.2 (2020-09-30)

This is a patch release for
[babashka/babashka.pods#20](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods/issues/20),
but it also introduces new support around `reify`.

### New

- Support `java.nio.file.FileVisitor` and `java.io.FilenameFilter` with `reify` [#600](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/600). Nice side effect: this makes babashka compatible with the [fs](https://github.com/clj-commons/fs) library:
    ``` clojure
    $ export BABASHKA_CLASSPATH=$(clojure -Spath -Sdeps '{:deps {clj-commons/fs {:mvn/version "1.5.2"}}}')
    $ bb -e '(ns foo (:require [me.raynes.fs :as fs])) (map str (fs/glob "*.md"))'
    ("/Users/borkdude/Dropbox/dev/clojure/glam/README.md")
    ```
- Add classes `java.util.zip.ZipInputStream` and `java.util.zip.ZipEntry`. This makes babashka compatible with [glam](https://github.com/borkdude/glam), a work in progress package manager.

### Fixed

- Ensure ns map exists for namespaces used only "code" vars [babashka/babashka.pods#20](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods/issues/20). This fixes compatibility with [bootleg](https://github.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg).

## v0.2.1 (2020-09-25)

- Support alternative interop form: `(. Integer -SIZE) ;;=> 32`
- [#454](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/454): syntax check on amount of arguments to `def`

## Prior to v0.1.0

Details about releases prior to v0.1.0 can be found
[here](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/releases).

## Breaking changes

### v0.2.4

- Remove cheshire smile functions [#658](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/658)

### v0.2.3

- The [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/babashka/babashka/) is now based on Ubuntu instead of Alpine.

### v0.0.90

- The `next.jdbc` namespace and PostgresQL driver, introduced in `v0.0.89`, are
  no longer part of the standardly distributed `bb` binary. This is now
  available behind a feature flag. See [feature flag
  documentation](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/blob/master/doc/build.md#feature-flags).
- [babashka/babashka.curl#16](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.curl/issues/16):
  Exceptional status codes or nonzero `curl` exit codes will throw exceptions by
  default. You can opt out with `:throw false`.

### v0.0.79
- [babashka.curl#9](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.curl/issues/9):
  Functions in `babashka.curl` like `get`, `post`, etc. now always return a map
  with `:status`, `:body`, and `:headers`.

### v0.0.71
- [#267](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/267) Change behavior of
  reader conditionals: the `:clj` branch is taken when it occurs before a `:bb`
  branch.

### v0.0.44 - 0.0.45
- [#173](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/173): Rename `*in*` to
  `*input*` (in the `user` namespace). The reason for this is that it shadowed
  `clojure.core/*in*` when used unqualified.

### v0.0.43
- [#160](https://github.com/babashka/babashka/issues/160): Add support for
  `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`. See docs. This replaces the `conch` namespace.
