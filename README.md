A Clojure [babushka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headscarf) for the grey areas of Bash.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Life's too short to remember how to write Bash code. I feel liberated.</p>
    &mdash;
    <a href="https://github.com/laheadle">@laheadle</a> on Clojurians Slack
</blockquote>

## Quickstart

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install)
$ ls | bb --time -i '(filter #(-> % io/file .isDirectory) *input*)'
("doc" "resources" "sci" "script" "src" "target" "test")
bb took 4ms.
```

## Rationale

The sweet spot for babashka is executing Clojure snippets or scripts in the same
space where you would use Bash.

As one user described it:

> I’m quite at home in Bash most of the time, but there’s a substantial grey area of things that are too complicated to be simple in bash, but too simple to be worth writing a clj/s script for. Babashka really seems to hit the sweet spot for those cases.

Goals:

* Fast startup / low latency. This is achieved by compiling to native using [GraalVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal).
* Familiarity and portability. Keep migration barriers between bash and Clojure as low as possible by:
  - Gradually introducing Clojure expressions to existing bash scripts
  - Scripts written in babashka should also be able to run on the JVM without major changes.
* Multi-threading support similar to Clojure on the JVM
* Batteries included (clojure.tools.cli, core.async, ...)

Non-goals:

* Performance
* Provide a mixed Clojure/bash DSL (see portability).
* Replace existing shells. Babashka is a tool you can use inside existing shells like bash and it is designed to play well with them. It does not aim to replace them.

Babashka uses [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) for interpreting Clojure. Sci
implements a subset of Clojure and is not as performant as compiled code. If your script is taking more than a few seconds,  Clojure on the JVM may be a better fit.

## Status

Experimental. Breaking changes are expected to happen at this phase. Keep an eye
on [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for a list of breaking changes.

## Examples

``` shellsession
$ ls | bb -i '*input*'
["LICENSE" "README.md" "bb" "doc" "pom.xml" "project.clj" "resources" "script" "src" "target" "test"]

$ ls | bb -i '(count *input*)'
12

$ bb '(vec (dedupe *input*))' <<< '[1 1 1 1 2]'
[1 2]

$ bb '(filterv :foo *input*)' <<< '[{:foo 1} {:bar 2}]'
[{:foo 1}]

$ bb '(#(+ %1 %2 %3) 1 2 *input*)' <<< 3
6

$ ls | bb -i '(filterv #(re-find #"README" %) *input*)'
["README.md"]

$ bb '(run! #(shell/sh "touch" (str "/tmp/test/" %)) (range 100))'
$ ls /tmp/test | bb -i '*input*'
["0" "1" "10" "11" "12" "13" "14" "15" "16" "17" "18" "19" "2" "20" "21" ...]

$ bb -O '(repeat "dude")' | bb --stream '(str *input* "rino")' | bb -I '(take 3 *input*)'
("duderino" "duderino" "duderino")
```

## Usage

``` shellsession
Usage: bb [ -i | -I ] [ -o | -O ] [ --stream ] [--verbose]
          [ ( --classpath | -cp ) <cp> ] [ --uberscript <file> ]
          [ ( --main | -m ) <main-namespace> | -e <expression> | -f <file> |
            --repl | --socket-repl [<host>:]<port> ]
          [ arg* ]

Options:

  --help, -h or -?    Print this help text.
  --version           Print the current version of babashka.

  -i                  Bind *input* to a lazy seq of lines from stdin.
  -I                  Bind *input* to a lazy seq of EDN values from stdin.
  -o                  Write lines to stdout.
  -O                  Write EDN values to stdout.
  --verbose           Print entire stacktrace in case of exception.
  --stream            Stream over lines or EDN values from stdin. Combined with -i or -I *input* becomes a single value per iteration.
  --uberscript <file> Collect preloads, -e, -f and -m and all required namespaces from the classpath into a single executable file.

  -e, --eval <expr>   Evaluate an expression.
  -f, --file <path>   Evaluate a file.
  -cp, --classpath    Classpath to use.
  -m, --main <ns>     Call the -main function from namespace with args.
  --repl              Start REPL
  --socket-repl       Start socket REPL. Specify port (e.g. 1666) or host and port separated by colon (e.g. 127.0.0.1:1666).
  --time              Print execution time before exiting.

If neither -e, -f, or --socket-repl are specified, then the first argument that is not parsed as a option is treated as a file if it exists, or as an expression otherwise.
Everything after that is bound to *command-line-args*.
```

The `clojure.core` functions are accessible without a namespace alias.

The following namespaces are required by default and available through the
pre-defined aliases in the `user` namespace. You may use `require` + `:as`
and/or `:refer` on these namespaces. If not all vars are available, they are
enumerated explicitly.

- `clojure.string` aliased as `str`
- `clojure.set` aliased as `set`
- `clojure.edn` aliased as `edn`:
  - `read-string`
- `clojure.java.shell` aliases as `shell`
- `clojure.java.io` aliased as `io`:
  - `as-relative-path`, `as-url`, `copy`, `delete-file`, `file`, `input-stream`,
    `make-parents`, `output-stream`, `reader`, `resource`, `writer`
- `clojure.main`: `repl`
- [`clojure.core.async`](https://clojure.github.io/core.async/) aliased as
  `async`. The `alt` and `go` macros are not available but `alts!!` does work as
  it is a function.
- `clojure.stacktrace`
- [`clojure.tools.cli`](https://github.com/clojure/tools.cli) aliased as `tools.cli`
- [`clojure.data.csv`](https://github.com/clojure/data.csv) aliased as `csv`
- [`cheshire.core`](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire) aliased as `json`

A selection of java classes are available, see `babashka/impl/classes.clj`.

Babashka supports `import`: `(import clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo)`.

Babashka supports a subset of the `ns` form where you may use `:require` and `:import`:

``` shellsession
(ns foo
  (:require [clojure.string :as str])
  (:import clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo))
```

For the unsupported parts of the ns form, you may use [reader
conditionals](#reader-conditionals) to maintain compatibility with JVM Clojure.

### Input and output flags

In one-liners the `*input*` value may come in handy. It contains the input read from stdin as EDN by default. If you want to read in text, use the `-i` flag, which binds `*input*` to a lazy seq of lines of text. If you want to read multiple EDN values, use the `-I` flag. The `-o` option prints the result as lines of text. The `-O` option prints the result as lines of EDN values.

The following table illustrates the combination of options for commands of the form

    echo "{{Input}}" | bb {{Input flags}} {{Output flags}} "*input*"

| Input          | Input flags | Output flag | `*input*`     | Output   |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| `{:a 1}` <br> `{:a 2}` |             |             | `{:a 1}`      | `{:a 1}` |
| hello <br> bye | `-i`        |             | `("hello" "bye")` |  `("hello" "bye")` |
| hello <br> bye | `-i`        |  `-o`       | `("hello" "bye")` |  hello <br> bye  |
| `{:a 1}` <br> `{:a 2}` | `-I`        |        | `({:a 1} {:a 2})` |  `({:a 1} {:a 2})`   |
| `{:a 1}` <br> `{:a 2}` | `-I` |  `-O`      | `({:a 1} {:a 2})` |  `{:a 1}` <br> `{:a 2}`   |

When combined with the `--stream` option, the expression is executed for each value in the input:

``` clojure
$ echo '{:a 1} {:a 2}' | bb --stream '*input*'
{:a 1}
{:a 2}
```

### Current file path

The var `*file*` contains the full path of the file that is currently being
executed:

``` shellsession
$ cat example.clj
(prn *file*)

$ bb example.clj
"/Users/borkdude/example.clj"
```

### Command-line arguments

Command-line arguments can be retrieved using `*command-line-args*`.

### Additional functions

Additionally, babashka adds the following functions:

- `wait/wait-for-port`. Usage:

``` clojure
(wait/wait-for-port "localhost" 8080)
(wait/wait-for-port "localhost" 8080 {:timeout 1000 :pause 1000})
```

Waits for TCP connection to be available on host and port. Options map supports `:timeout` and `:pause`. If `:timeout` is provided and reached, `:default`'s value (if any) is returned. The `:pause` option determines the time waited between retries.

- `wait/wait-for-path`. Usage:

``` clojure
(wait/wait-for-path "/tmp/wait-path-test")
(wait/wait-for-path "/tmp/wait-path-test" {:timeout 1000 :pause 1000})
```

Waits for file path to be available. Options map supports `:default`, `:timeout` and `:pause`. If `:timeout` is provided and reached, `:default`'s value (if any) is returned. The `:pause` option determines the time waited between retries.

- `sig/pipe-signal-received?`. Usage:

``` clojure
(sig/pipe-signal-received?)
```

Returns true if `PIPE` signal was received. Example:

``` shellsession
$ bb '((fn [x] (println x) (when (not (sig/pipe-signal-received?)) (recur (inc x)))) 0)' | head -n2
1
2
```

## Running a file

Scripts may be executed from a file using `-f` or `--file`:

``` shellsession
bb -f download_html.clj
```

Files can also be loaded inline using `load-file`:

``` shellsession
bb '(load-file "script.clj")'
```

Using `bb` with a shebang also works:

``` clojure
#!/usr/bin/env bb

(defn get-url [url]
  (println "Fetching url:" url)
  (let [{:keys [:exit :err :out]} (shell/sh "curl" "-sS" url)]
    (if (zero? exit) out
      (do (println "ERROR:" err)
          (System/exit 1)))))

(defn write-html [file html]
  (println "Writing file:" file)
  (spit file html))

(let [[url file] *command-line-args*]
  (when (or (empty? url) (empty? file))
    (println "Usage: <url> <file>")
    (System/exit 1))
  (write-html file (get-url url)))

(System/exit 0)
```

``` shellsession
$ ./download_html.clj
Usage: <url> <file>

$ ./download_html.clj https://www.clojure.org /tmp/clojure.org.html
Fetching url: https://www.clojure.org
Writing file: /tmp/clojure.org.html
```

If `/usr/bin/env` doesn't work for you, you can use the following workaround:

``` shellsession
$ cat script.clj
#!/bin/sh

#_(
   "exec" "bb" "$0" hello "$@"
   )

(prn *command-line-args*)

./script.clj 1 2 3
("hello" "1" "2" "3")
```

## Preloads

The environment variable `BABASHKA_PRELOADS` allows to define code that will be
available in all subsequent usages of babashka.

``` shellsession
BABASHKA_PRELOADS='(defn foo [x] (+ x 2))'
BABASHKA_PRELOADS=$BABASHKA_PRELOADS' (defn bar [x] (* x 2))'
export BABASHKA_PRELOADS
```

Note that you can concatenate multiple expressions. Now you can use these functions in babashka:

``` shellsession
$ bb '(-> (foo *input*) bar)' <<< 1
6
```

You can also preload an entire file using `load-file`:

``` shellsession
export BABASHKA_PRELOADS='(load-file "my_awesome_prelude.clj")'
```

Note that `*input*` is not available in preloads.

## Classpath

Babashka accepts a `--classpath` option that will be used to search for
namespaces and load them:

``` clojure
$ cat src/my/namespace.clj
(ns my.namespace)
(defn -main [& _args]
  (println "Hello from my namespace!"))

$ bb --classpath src --main my.namespace
Hello from my namespace!
```

Note that you can use the `clojure` tool to produce classpaths and download dependencies:

``` shellsession
$ cat deps.edn
{:deps
 {my_gist_script
  {:git/url "https://gist.github.com/borkdude/263b150607f3ce03630e114611a4ef42"
   :sha "cfc761d06dfb30bb77166b45d439fe8fe54a31b8"}}
 :aliases {:my-script {:main-opts ["-m" "my-gist-script"]}}}

$ CLASSPATH=$(clojure -Spath)
$ bb --classpath "$CLASSPATH" --main my-gist-script
Hello from gist script!
```

If there is no `--classpath` argument, the `BABASHKA_CLASSPATH` environment
variable will be used:

``` shellsession
$ export BABASHKA_CLASSPATH=$(clojure -Spath)
$ export BABASHKA_PRELOADS="(require '[my-gist-script])"
$ bb "(my-gist-script/-main)"
Hello from gist script!
```

### Deps.clj

The [`deps.clj`](https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj/) script can be used to work with `deps.edn`-based projects:

``` shell
$ deps.clj -A:my-script -Scommand "bb -cp {{classpath}} {{main-opts}}"
Hello from gist script!
```

Create these aliases for brevity:

``` shell
$ alias bbk='deps.clj -Scommand "bb -cp {{classpath}} {{main-opts}}"'
$ alias babashka='rlwrap deps.clj -Scommand "bb -cp {{classpath}} {{main-opts}}"'
$ bbk -A:my-script
Hello from gist script!
$ babashka
Babashka v0.0.58 REPL.
Use :repl/quit or :repl/exit to quit the REPL.
Clojure rocks, Bash reaches.

user=> (require '[my-gist-script :as mgs])
nil
user=> (mgs/-main)
Hello from gist script!
nil
```

## Uberscript

The `--uberscript` option collects the expressions in
`BABASHKA_PRELOADS`, the command line expression or file, the main entrypoint
and all required namespaces from the classpath into a single file. This can be
convenient for debugging and deployment.

Given the `deps.edn` from above:

``` clojure
$ deps.clj -A:my-script -Scommand "bb -cp {{classpath}} {{main-opts}} --uberscript my-script.clj"

$ cat my-script.clj
(ns my-gist-script)
(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello from gist script!"))
(ns user (:require [my-gist-script]))
(apply my-gist-script/-main *command-line-args*)

$ bb my-script.clj
Hello from gist script!
```

## Parsing command line arguments

Babashka ships with `clojure.tools.cli`:

``` clojure
(require '[clojure.tools.cli :refer [parse-opts]])

(def cli-options
  ;; An option with a required argument
  [["-p" "--port PORT" "Port number"
    :default 80
    :parse-fn #(Integer/parseInt %)
    :validate [#(< 0 % 0x10000) "Must be a number between 0 and 65536"]]
   ["-h" "--help"]])

(:options (parse-opts *command-line-args* cli-options))
```

``` shellsession
$ bb script.clj
{:port 80}
$ bb script.clj -h
{:port 80, :help true}
```

## Reader conditionals

Babashka supports reader conditionals using the `:bb` feature:

``` clojure
$ cat example.clj
#?(:clj (in-ns 'foo) :bb (println "babashka doesn't support in-ns yet!"))

$ ./bb example.clj
babashka doesn't support in-ns yet!
```

## Socket REPL

Start the socket REPL like this:

``` shellsession
$ bb --socket-repl 1666
Babashka socket REPL started at localhost:1666
```

Now you can connect with your favorite socket REPL client:

``` shellsession
$ rlwrap nc 127.0.0.1 1666
Babashka v0.0.14 REPL.
Use :repl/quit or :repl/exit to quit the REPL.
Clojure rocks, Bash reaches.

bb=> (+ 1 2 3)
6
bb=> :repl/quit
$
```

A socket REPL client for Emacs is
[inf-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure).

## Spawning and killing a process

Use the `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` class.

Example:

``` clojure
user=> (def ws (-> (ProcessBuilder. ["python" "-m" "SimpleHTTPServer" "1777"]) (.start)))
#'user/ws
user=> (wait/wait-for-port "localhost" 1777)
{:host "localhost", :port 1777, :took 2}
user=> (.destroy ws)
nil
```

Also see this [example](examples/process_builder.clj).

## Async

Apart from `future` and `pmap` for creating threads, you may use the `async`
namespace, which maps to `clojure.core.async`, for asynchronous scripting. The
following example shows how to get first available value from two different
processes:

``` clojure
bb '
(defn async-command [& args]
  (async/thread (apply shell/sh "bash" "-c" args)))

(-> (async/alts!! [(async-command "sleep 2 && echo process 1")
                   (async-command "sleep 1 && echo process 2")])
    first :out str/trim println)'
process 2
```

## Differences with Clojure

Babashka is implemented using the [Small Clojure
Interpreter](https://github.com/borkdude/sci). This means that a snippet or
script is not compiled to JVM bytecode, but executed form by form by a runtime
which implements a subset of Clojure. Babashka is compiled to a native binary
using [GraalVM](https://github.com/oracle/graal). It comes with a selection of
built-in namespaces and functions from Clojure and other useful libraries. The
data types (numbers, strings, persistent collections) are the
same. Multi-threading is supported (`pmap`, `future`).

Differences with Clojure:

- A subset of Java classes are supported.

- Only the `clojure.core`, `clojure.set`, `clojure.string` and `clojure.walk`
  namespaces are available from Clojure.

- Interpretation comes with overhead. Therefore tight loops are likely slower
  than in Clojure on the JVM.

- No support for unboxed types.

## External resources

## Developing Babashka

To work on Babashka itself make sure Git submodules are checked out.

``` shellsession
$ git clone https://github.com/borkdude/babashka --recursive
```

To update later on:

``` shellsession
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

You need [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/), and for building binaries you need GraalVM.

### REPL

`lein repl` will get you a standard REPL/nREPL connection. To work on tests use `lein with-profiles +test repl`.

### Adding classes

Add necessary classes to `babashka/impl/classes.clj`.  For every addition, write
a unit test, so it's clear why it is added and removing it will break the
tests. Try to reduce the size of the binary by only adding the necessary parts
of a class in `:instance-check`, `:constructors`, `:methods`, `:fields` or
`:custom`.

The `reflection.json` file that is needed for GraalVM compilation is generated
with:

    lein with-profiles +reflection run

### Test

Test on the JVM (for development):

    script/test

Test the native version:

    BABASHKA_TEST_ENV=native script/test

### Build

To build this project, set `$GRAALVM_HOME` to the GraalVM distribution directory.

Then run:

    script/compile

$ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/borkdude/babashka/tags |
jet --from json --keywordize --to edn |
bb '(-> *input* first :name (subs 1))'
"0.0.4"
```

### Get latest OS-specific download url from Github

$ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/borkdude/babashka/releases |
jet --from json --keywordize |
bb '(-> *input* first :assets)' |
bb '(some #(re-find #".*linux.*" (:browser_download_url %)) *input*)'
"https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases/download/v0.0.4/babashka-0.0.4-linux-amd64.zip"
```

### Portable tree command

See [examples/tree.clj](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/master/examples/tree.clj).

``` shellsession
$ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/tools.cli {:mvn/version "0.4.2"}}}' examples/tree.clj src
src
└── babashka
    ├── impl
    │   ├── tools
    │   │   └── cli.clj
...

$ examples/tree.clj src
src
└── babashka
    ├── impl
    │   ├── tools
    │   │   └── cli.clj
...
```

### List outdated maven dependencies

See [examples/outdated.clj](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/master/examples/outdated.clj).
Inspired by an idea from [@seancorfield](https://github.com/seancorfield).

``` shellsession
$ cat /tmp/deps.edn
{:deps {cheshire {:mvn/version "5.8.1"}
        clj-http {:mvn/version "3.4.0"}}}

$ examples/outdated.clj /tmp/deps.edn
clj-http/clj-http can be upgraded from 3.4.0 to 3.10.0
cheshire/cheshire can be upgraded from 5.8.1 to 5.9.0
```

### Convert project.clj to deps.edn

Contributed by [@plexus](https://github.com/plexus).

``` shellsession
$ cat project.clj |
sed -e 's/#=//g' -e 's/~@//g' -e 's/~//g' |
bb '(let [{:keys [dependencies source-paths resource-paths]} (apply hash-map (drop 3 *input*))]
  {:paths (into source-paths resource-paths)
   :deps (into {} (for [[d v] dependencies] [d {:mvn/version v}]))}) ' |
jet --pretty > deps.edn
```
