A sprinkle of Clojure for the command line.

## Quickstart

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install)
$ bb '(vec (dedupe *in*))' <<< '[1 1 1 1 2]'
[1 2]
```

## Rationale

If you're a bash expert, you probably don't need this. But for those of us who
scan use a bit of Clojure in their shell scripts, it may be useful.

Properties:

- fast startup time
- code is interpreted by [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci), a small Clojure
  interpreter
- reads from stdin and writes to stdout

## Status

Experimental. Breaking changes are expected to happen at this phase.

## Installation

### Brew

Linux and macOS binaries are provided via brew.

Install:

    brew install borkdude/brew/babashka

Upgrade:

    brew upgrade babashka


### Installer script

Install via the installer script:

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install)
```

By default this will install into `/usr/local/bin`. To change this, provide the directory name:

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install) /tmp
```

### Download

You may also download a binary from [Github](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases).

## Usage

``` shellsession
bb [ --help ] [ -i ] [ -o ] [ -io ] [ --version ] [ -f <file> ] [ expression ]
```

Type `bb --help` to see a full explanation of the options.

There is one special variable, `*in*`, which is the input read from stdin. The
input is read as EDN by default. If the `-i` flag is provided, then the input is
read as a string which is then split on newlines. The output is printed as EDN
by default, unless the `-o` flag is provided, then the output is turned into
shell-scripting friendly output. To combine `-i` and `-o` you can use `-io`.

The current version can be printed with `bb --version`.

Currently only the following special forms/macros are supported: anonymous
function literals like `#(%1 %2)`, `quote`, `do`,`if`, `when`, `let`, `and`,
`or`, `->`, `->>`, `as->`. Anonymous functions literals are allowed with
currently up to three positional arguments.

The `clojure.core` functions are accessible without a namespace alias.

The following Clojure namespaces are required by default and only available
through the aliases:

- `clojure.string` aliased as `str`
- `clojure.set` aliased as `set`
- `clojure.java.shell` aliases as `shell` (only `sh` is available)

From Java the following is available:

- `System`: `getProperty`, `getProperties`, `getenv`

Examples:

``` shellsession
$ ls | bb -i '*in*'
["LICENSE" "README.md" "bb" "doc" "pom.xml" "project.clj" "reflection.json" "resources" "script" "src" "target" "test"]

$ ls | bb -i '(count *in*)'
12

$ bb '(vec (dedupe *in*))' <<< '[1 1 1 1 2]'
[1 2]

$ bb '(filterv :foo *in*)' <<< '[{:foo 1} {:bar 2}]'
[{:foo 1}]
```

``` shellsession
$ bb '(#(+ %1 %2 %3) 1 2 *in*)' <<< 3
6
```

``` shellsession
$ ls | bb -i '(filterv #(re-find #"reflection" %) *in*)'
["reflection.json"]
```

``` shellsession
$ bb '(run! #(shell/sh "touch" (str "/tmp/test/" %)) (range 100))'
$ ls /tmp/test | bb -i '*in*'
["0" "1" "10" "11" "12" "13" "14" "15" "16" "17" "18" "19" "2" "20" "21" ...]
```

More examples can be found in the [gallery](#gallery).

## Running a file

Babashka expressions may be executed from a file using `-f` or `--file`:

``` shellsession
bb -f script.clj
```

Using `bb` with a shebang also works:

``` shellsession
$ cat script.clj
#!/usr/bin/env bb -f

(+ 1 2 3)

$ ./script.clj
6
```

## Test

Test on the JVM:

    script/test

Although this tool doesn't offer any benefit when running on the JVM, it is
convenient for development.

Test the native version:

    BABASHKA_TEST_ENV=native script/test

## Build

You will need leiningen and GraalVM.

    script/compile
