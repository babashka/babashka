[![cljdoc badge](https://cljdoc.org/badge/borkdude/babashka)](https://cljdoc.org/d/borkdude/babashka/CURRENT)

A sprinkle of Clojure for the command line.

## Quickstart

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install)
$ bb '(vec (dedupe *in*))' <<< '[1 1 1 1 2]'
[1 2]
```

## Rationale

If you're a bash expert, you probably don't need this. But for those of us who
can use a bit of Clojure in their shell scripts, it may be useful.

Properties:

- fast startup time
- code is interpreted by [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci), a small Clojure
  interpreter
- reads from stdin and writes to stdout

## Status

Experimental. Breaking changes are expected to happen at this phase.

## Installation

### Brew

Linux and macOS binaries are provided via brew.

Install:

    brew install borkdude/brew/babashka

Upgrade:

    brew upgrade babashka


### Installer script

Install via the installer script:

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install)
```

By default this will install into `/usr/local/bin`. To change this, provide the directory name:

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/babashka/master/install) /tmp
```

### Download

You may also download a binary from [Github](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases).

## Usage

``` shellsession
... | bb [-i] [-o] '<Clojure form>'
```

There is one special variable, `*in*`, which is the input read from stdin. The
input is read as EDN by default. If the `-i` flag is provided, then the input is
read as a string which is then split on newlines. The output is printed as EDN
by default, unless the `-o` flag is provided, then the output is turned into
shell-scripting friendly output. To combine `-i` and `-o` you can use `-io`.

The current version can be printed with `bb --version`.

Currently only the macros `if`, `when`, `and`, `or`, `->`, `->>` and `as->` are
supported.

Examples:

``` shellsession
$ ls | bb -i '*in*'
["LICENSE" "README.md" "bb" "doc" "pom.xml" "project.clj" "reflection.json" "resources" "script" "src" "target" "test"]

$ ls | bb -i '(count *in*)'
12

$ bb '(vec (dedupe *in*))' <<< '[1 1 1 1 2]'
[1 2]

$ bb '(filterv :foo *in*)' <<< '[{:foo 1} {:bar 2}]'
[{:foo 1}]
```

Anonymous functions literals are allowed with currently up to three positional
arguments.

``` shellsession
$ bb '(#(+ %1 %2 %3) 1 2 *in*)' <<< 3
6
```

``` shellsession
$ ls | bb -i '(filterv #(re-find #"reflection" %) *in*)'
["reflection.json"]
```

More examples can be found in the [gallery](#gallery).

## Test

Test on the JVM:

    script/test

Although this tool doesn't offer any benefit when running on the JVM, it is
convenient for development.

Test the native version:

    BABASHKA_TEST_ENV=native script/test

## Build

You will need leiningen and GraalVM.

    script/compile

### Fetch latest Github release tag

For converting JSON to EDN, see [jet](https://github.com/borkdude/jet).

``` shellsession
$ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/borkdude/babashka/tags |
jet --from json --keywordize --to edn |
bb '(-> *in* first :name (subs 1))'
"0.0.4"
```

``` shellsession
$ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/borkdude/babashka/releases |
jet --from json --keywordize |
bb '(-> *in* first :assets)' |
bb '(some #(re-find #".*linux.*" (:browser_download_url %)) *in*)'
"https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases/download/v0.0.4/babashka-0.0.4-linux-amd64.zip"
```
